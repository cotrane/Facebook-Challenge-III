Facebook-Challenge-III
======================

contains the code i used for my submission for the Kaggle Facebook III challenge. The task was to predict tags for posts on StackOverflow. It computes word frequencies for the train and test set. For submission it creates the coocurrency matrix for the train set, computes the tf-idf matrix and uses cosine similarity to make predictions for questions in the test set.
